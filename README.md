## 💻 What I’m About
- 🎓 Background in **Computer Science** and **Welding**
- ⚙️ Focused on creating useful, fun, and sometimes quirky tools
- 🧠 Currently learning **TypeScript**, **Express.js**, and exploring **drone tech**
- 🧩 I love automating things, building helpful side projects, and diving into new tech
